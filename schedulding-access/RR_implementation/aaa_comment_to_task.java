     For this task I will use the usual arraylist (from "standard" library). Here it will be different than for FCFS
     and SJF, the request queue will be constant (new processes won't arrive).
     The user will choice size q (quantum of process execution time), and k(switching time between processes).
     Due to the fact that q does not have to be an integer, here I work on double values
