    I decided to implement the FIFO queue using the queue interface and the basis of my queue is a linked-list.
    I didn't use the "standard" library.
    I started by creating the interface and implementing it myself.
    Everything is simulated by loop iteration. 1 iteration = 1 time unit.
    Iterator is implemented using a other than custom method, because I noticed that to calculate the average wait
    time for the process, you need the value of all items after the last.
